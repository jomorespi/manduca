It comes with some basic options and a modern, lightweight Tailwind CSS 4-powered layout system. 

If you want to publish your own custom, self-hosted, and accessible links homepage, Manduca is a simple and fast solution. It only needs a few minutes for customization and deployment.

## Quick start

To use this template, just launch the console and type:

```sh
pnpm create astro@latest my-project -- --template jomorespi/manduca
cd my-project
pnpm dev
```

<small>(of course, you can work with `npm` or `yarn` if you prefer)</small>

Alternatively, you can clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jomorespi/manduca.git
cd manduca
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## Content and Customization

This theme includes a `settings.json` file to make customization easier. In this file you can change display options as well as manipulate the content of your homepage.

Furthermore, thanks to the power of Tailwind CSS 4, you can manipulate its appearance with little effort.

1. Open `src/settings.json`
    - Choose between style options.
    - Write your name and description. Add your profile image.
    - Set your custom links and social media profiles.
2. Open `src/assets/styles/theme.css`
    - Set your custom accent color (make sure we all can enjoy your site: [whocanuse.com](https://www.whocanuse.com/)).
    - Change anything you want.

By manipulating only these two files, you'll have your custom Link in Bio page ready.

### Settings file

You'll find a few options in the settings file:

#### Style
```json
"Align": "center", // Two layout modes: center / left
"Decoration": "all" // Four options for decorative elements: avatar / lines / all / none
```

#### Content

```json
"Language": "en" // Make sure to use a valid ISO Language Code (see w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp)
```

#### Header
```json
"Name": "", // Your name
"Bio": "", // Description text
"Avatar": "default2.webp" // Save your image in the folder: public/img
```

#### Links

Just add your links following the examples in the file. They will appear on the homepage as large buttons.

```json
"My last album": "https://bandcamp.com/me/myalbum",
"My last video": "https://vimeo.com/myvideo",
```

#### Social

The available social media icons are: Linkedin, Mastodon, Bluesky, Threads, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, Snapchat, Facebook, Vimeo, YouTube, TikTok, Twitch, Bandcamp, SoundCloud, Tidal, Spotify, GitHub, GitLab, Codeberg, StackOverflow, Discord, Behance, Dribbble, Reddit, Quora, Substack, Medium, WordPress, WhatsApp, Telegram and Strava.

If you add a custom item, it will also appear with a link icon:

```json

```

#### Footer

```json
"Text": "", // Just a copyright, date, or disclaimer text in the footer
"Menu": {}  // If you need to add custom content pages to your website, you can link them from this menu. Use relative links (without the leading slash). Examples: "about", "contact", "policy"
```

### Content pages

You can add content pages and edit them using Markdown. Just add as many `.md` files as you need in the pages folder: `src/pages`. Make sure you use the correct layout:

```md
---
layout: ../layouts/PageLayout.astro
title: "My page title"
---
```
